		<h1>BabyElephant</h1>
		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>As the name suggests, this
			is an elephant that is always
			a baby; just like we have baby
			corn and baby tomatoes in plants.

			The BabyElephant is a species of
			elephant that is peculiar to a
			few paradisic areas in Africa,
			like The Hutchery Studios. The
			BabyElephant is known to live on
			music, which always causes it to
			be high on life. This is a spiritual
			animal like no other.

			Music is life, for this animal. In
			the morning, the BabyElephant will be
			found making music to feed its soul.
			The energy fro the music, is then used
			in the afternoon to dance for the universe
			and spread good vibes around its padisic
			environment.</p>
		<h3>Habitat</h3>

			Africa. Paradisic which comes from the word
